This is a fork of [Syntect](https://crates.io/crates/syntect).

This fork hosts a "version-4.6" branch which is very similar to the original version 4.6 of Syntect, the last non yanked version of Syntect at time of writing, but modified to return errors instead of panicking in some cases of failing syntaxic colorings.

There's no project to maintain this fork for a long time nor for adding features: as soon as Syntect 5 is released without cases of panics and the applications using this fork are ported, it will be terminated.
