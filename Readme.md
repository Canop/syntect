# syntect-5-no-panic

This is a fork of [Syntect](https://crates.io/crates/syntect).

This fork is very similar to the original version 5.2 of Syntect, but modified to return errors or behave differently instead of panicking in some cases of failing syntaxic colorings or in case of regexes not compatible with the selected engine.

Please try to use the original Syntect instead of this temporary fork.

There's no project to add features: as soon as I can use the normal syntect, this repository will be considered obsolete.

If you really feel like you need to use this, contact @dystroy on [the Miaou chat](https://miaou.dystroy.org/3768).
